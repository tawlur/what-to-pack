<!-- In addition to the typical boilerplate (don’t forget to link in stylesheets/style.css), add some basic navigation to header.ejs so that you have a place to add links when implementing the auth, etc.  Add a basic “home” link for now that routes to the root route (landing page) - something like <a href="/">HOME or WHATEVER YOU WANT</a> .  Make a commit. -->
